	<h4>Overriding and Creating Styles</h4>
	<p>In some cases you may wish to override the default styles provided with the framework, or add some of your own. Sitecore provides the ability to specify a stylesheet that contains your overrides and new styles. <strong>Do not use inline styles</strong>, as these add time to page load, increase difficulty of making changes at a later date, interfere with print styling, and can negatively impact search rankings. Also, as a best practice we strive to keep the presentation layer separate from the content.</p>
