	<h3>Components</h3>
	<h4>Summary</h4>
	<div class="content-description">
		<p>Components are functional content pieces that have been prebuilt so you are able to use them throughout your website. You can add components to a page through Sitecore's Page Editor.</p>

	<h4>Carousel</h4>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span6">
			<p>A carousel contains several slides that the user can navigate through. Slides can contain an image with a caption, video, or HTML content. The carousel should be used to display content with a high priority to the user, such as highlighting news stories or upcoming events. The carousel should not be used to display static images.</p>

	<h4>Video</h4>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span6">
			<p>The video component allows you to display a thumbnail image with a play icon and caption. When the user clicks the thumbnail, the video will appear in a modal window. If the user is on a mobile device, they will be directed to the mobile friendly page for the video. You have the option of providing a thumbnail for the video, or automatically obtaining one from the provider. Only YouTube and Vimeo are supported currently.</p>

	<h4>Data Lists</h4>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span6">
			<p>Data lists are used throughout the site to display media items, news headlines, links, and lists of data. The data list is best used to display links. If an additional link is required to "view more", the class "bottom-row" should be used. Data lists should not be used in page content to display a list of standard items, instead an ordered or unordered list should be used.</p>

	<h4>Accordion</h4>
	<div class="row-fluid">
		<div class="span6">
			<p>The accordion is used to display large amounts of nested links. The user has the choice of clicking the top level link, or choosing to expand the top level element and browse the links below it. Because the accordion has such a large number of links, the links should be ordered alphabetically so the user can easily find what they are looking for. If the number of top level categories is less than 10, the categorized link bucket should be used instead.</p>

<h4>Categorized Link Bucket</h4>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span6">
		<p>The cateogirzed link bucket is similar to the accordion, but displays links in a horizontal manner as opposed to vertically. The categorized link bucket is also filterable by typing a query into the input field labelled "filter links". Links can optionally be sorted by popularity (from analytics) instead of alphabetically. The number of categories (on the left) should not exceed 10.</p>

<h4>Tabs</h4>
<div class="row-fluid">
	<div class="span6">
		<p>Tabs are useful for using one area to target multiple audiences or for grouping types of content, but hiding pieces that may not be of interest to all users.</p>
